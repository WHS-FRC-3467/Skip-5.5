    - Update PCM
    
Bag Time:
    - Update roboRio
    - Update Talons
    - Update PDP
    - Update PCM

Controls:
- Move some functions to driver joystick:
    Conveyor intake (variable speeds)
    Drop conveyor to floor (to initiate pickup)

Auto Routines (use in auto or teleop):
- (done) elevatorCGAddTote: Index a tote
- (done) elevatorCGDropStack: Drop entire stack down on conveyor
- (done) elevatorCGDropStackWithToteOnConveyor: Just what it says ;-) 

- Drive straight/left/right/back for distance
- Turn to desired angle

- Pickup RC (roll in and drive forward)
- Upright an RC (drop conveyor on bottom and drive backwards)

- Index RC commands




Conveyor:
- Vary eject speed based on number of totes aboard

Drivebase:
 - Test and implement Speed PID for mecanum driving
 - Get MXP working

Power Distribution:
 - (Done) create wrapper class around PowerDistributionPanel singleton
 - provide enums for controller channels
 - provide current readings
 - allow subsytems to register for brownout notifications
