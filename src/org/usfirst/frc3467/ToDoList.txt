 *  TODO List:
 */
 
 Updated:     2/23/15

Controls:
- Move some functions to driver joystick:
    Conveyor intake (variable speeds)
    Drop conveyor to floor (to initiate pickup)

Auto Routines (use in auto or teleop):
- (done) elevatorCGAddTote: Index a tote
- (done) elevatorCGDropStack: Drop entire stack down on conveyor
- (done) elevatorCGDropStackWithToteOnConveyor: Just what it says ;-) 

- Drive straight/left/right/back for distance
- Turn to desired angle

- Pickup RC (roll in and drive forward)
- Upright an RC (drop conveyor on bottom and drive backwards)


Elevator:
- When lowering stack off the indexers, drive slowly down at fixed speed, monitoring position.
    When position is hit or passed, switch to PID to hold position
- Fix the "go up/down" command
- Provide commands for counting totes (and RC)
- Index RC command




Conveyor:
- Vary eject speed based on number of totes aboard
- Investigate current loads when intaking a tote


Drivebase:
 - Test and implement Speed PID for mecanum driving
 

Power Distribution:
 - create wrapper class
 - provide enums for controller channels
 - provide current readings
 - allow subsytems to register for brownout notifications


LEDs:
 - create service class
 - provide API for lighting LED indicator strips
